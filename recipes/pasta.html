<p>This is called the vegetarian rasta pasta. This is a simple, delicious pasta that can be easily made in twenty minutes. This is perfect for a simple, delicious dinner.</p> 
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Red pepper</li>
    <li>Garlic</li>
    <li>Yellow pepper</li>
    <li>Cream cheese</li>
    <li>Stock cube</li>
    <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
    <li>Onion</li>
    <li>Pasta</li>
    <li>Jerk seasoning</li>
    <li>Oil</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Put the pasta water to boil and salt it well. It should taste like seawater. I usually add a tablespoon of salt. Deseed the peppers and slice them into strips, peel and thinly slice the onion, and peel and mince the garlic. Add the oil to a large deep frying pan and heat on medium-high. When the oil is very hot, add the slice peppers and onions. Your pasta water should be boiling so add the pasta and cook according to the package directions.</li>
    <li>Fry the mixture for five to seven minutes until the peppers are slightly softened and the onion is softened and slightly browned. Add the minced garlic, mix and fry for one minute more.</li>
    <li>Add the jerk seasoning and toss with the vegetables. Cook for one to two minutes, stirring often until the spices are toasted and fragrant.</li>
    <li>Add the cream cheese, and a cup of pasta water, and crumble in the stock cube. Your pasta should be done around now and I recommend you reserve two cups of pasta water (one for now, the other for later if you want to thin the sauce). If it’s not done I just dip a mug or measuring cup into the pot to get the water I need for the sauce.</li>
    <li>Mix everything up, and use a wooden spoon to break up the cream cheese so it melts into the sauce better. Once the cream cheese has been mixed in fully and there are no lumps of it left in the sauce, turn off the heat and take the pan off the heat. Add the grated parmesan and mix until combined. Taste the sauce and adjust the salt if needed. Personally, I don’t add any extra salt as the pasta water is salted, jerk seasoning usually has salt, and the stock cube too, so it’s usually salty enough but this might be different for you depending on which brands you use.</li>
    <li>Add the drained pasta to the pan (note, do not rinse your drained pasta as it will make it hard for the sauce to stick to it). Toss until coated in the sauce. Use the second cup of reserved pasta water to thin the sauce a little if needed.</li>
